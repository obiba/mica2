individual-studies-callout = An individual study is defined as any epidemiological study (e.g. cohort, case control, cross sectional, etc.) conducted to better understand the distribution and determinants of health and disease. It defines populations (a set of individuals sharing the same selection criteria for enrollment in a study) with data collection events (a collection of information on one population over a specific period of time, e.g. baseline, follow-up 1, follow-up 2).
